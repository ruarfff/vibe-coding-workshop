## 📚 Quick Reference

### The Quality Checklist (Kim & Yegge)

When working with AI, remember:

- 🍼 **Count your babies** — Verify every component was delivered
- 🧁 **Check for cardboard muffins** — Look beyond "it works"
- ⭐ **Demand excellence explicitly** — You get the quality you ask for
- 🧹 **Clean as you go** — Build cleanup into every task
- 🔍 **Trust but verify** — Always review AI output

### When Things Go Wrong

- 📋 **Copy/paste** error messages to the AI
- 📸 **Screenshot** visual problems
- 💬 Describe **expected vs actual** behavior
- 🔄 **Iterate** — errors are just conversation starters
