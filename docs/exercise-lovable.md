# Exercise 1: Building an App with Lovable.dev

**Goal:** Build a functional web app using only natural language
**Requirements:** Browser, free Lovable.dev account

---

## What is Lovable.dev?

Lovable.dev is an AI-powered platform that creates full-stack web applications from natural language descriptions. You describe what you want, and the AI builds it — complete with UI, database, and functionality.

**No coding required.** You just describe your idea like you would to a colleague.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create an Account
1. Go to [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev)
2. Click **Sign Up** (or **Log In** if you already have an account)
3. Use your email or Google/GitHub authentication

### Step 2: Start a New Project
1. Click **Create New Project**
2. You'll see a chat interface where you can describe your app

---

## Your Task

### Choose an App Idea

Pick one of these ideas (or create your own!):

| Idea | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 📝 **To-Do List** | A personal task manager with categories and due dates |
| 🎂 **Birthday Tracker** | Keep track of friends' and family's birthdays |
| 💰 **Expense Tracker** | Log daily expenses and see totals by category |
| 🎯 **Habit Tracker** | Track daily habits with streaks and progress |
| 📖 **Recipe Book** | Store and organize your favorite recipes |
| 🌤️ **Weather Dashboard** | Show current weather for your city |

### Describe Your App

Type a description like this in the chat:

> **Example prompt:**
> "Create a simple to-do list app where I can:
> - Add new tasks with a title and due date
> - Mark tasks as complete
> - Delete tasks I don't need
> - See completed tasks in a separate section
> Use a clean, modern design with blue as the primary color."

### Watch It Build

Lovable will:
1. Generate the UI components
2. Add functionality
3. Deploy a live preview you can interact with

**This usually takes 30-60 seconds.**

## Iterating on Your App

Once your app is built, you can keep adding features:

### Adding Features
> "Add a category field so I can organize tasks into Work, Personal, and Shopping"

### Changing Design
> "Change the color scheme to dark mode with purple accents"

### Fixing Issues
> "The delete button isn't working. Can you fix it?"

### Adding Data
> "Add some sample tasks so I can see how it looks with data"

---

## Tips for Success

### ✅ Do This

- **Be specific about features** — "Add a due date" is better than "make it better"
- **Describe the user experience** — "When I click the button, show a success message"
- **Mention design preferences** — "Use a minimalist design" or "Make it colorful and fun"
- **Iterate in small steps** — Add one feature at a time

### ❌ Avoid This

- Describing the entire app in one message can make things harder to track
- Don't get too frustrated if it doesn't turn out right — just ask for changes or start again

## Example Conversation

Here's what a typical session might look like:

**You:** "Create a birthday reminder app where I can save birthdays with the person's name and date. Show me upcoming birthdays in the next 30 days."

**Lovable:** *Builds initial app with a form and list*

**You:** "Add a way to categorize people as Family, Friends, or Coworkers"

**Lovable:** *Adds category dropdown and filters*

**You:** "Show how many days until each birthday"

**Lovable:** *Adds countdown calculation*

**You:** "The date picker is hard to use on mobile. Can you make it bigger?"

**Lovable:** *Improves mobile responsiveness*

---

## Sharing Your App

Once you're happy with your app:

1. Click the **Share** button
2. Copy the link
3. Share or save it for later

Your app is deployed and accessible from any browser!

---

## Wrap-Up Questions

After completing the exercise, reflect on:

1. How was this different from your expectations?
2. What surprised you about the process?
3. What would you build with more time?

---

## Next Steps

Now that you've built an app with Lovable, you're ready for:

- **Exercise 2:** GitHub Copilot — have AI implement features in a codebase
- **Exercise 3:** Snowflake SQL — generate database queries from natural language
